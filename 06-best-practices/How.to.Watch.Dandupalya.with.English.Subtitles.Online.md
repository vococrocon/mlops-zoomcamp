Dandupalya is a film that explores the dark and brutal side of human nature. It depicts the crimes of a gang that targeted women and elderly people in the outskirts of Bangalore. The gang members would pose as policemen, plumbers, electricians or salesmen to gain entry into the houses. They would then rob, rape and murder their victims in cold blood.
  
The film does not shy away from showing the graphic violence and gore that the gang inflicted on their victims. It also shows the psychological impact of their actions on themselves and their families. The film challenges the viewers to question their own morality and empathy.
  
The film has received mixed reviews from critics and audiences. Some praised it for its realistic and bold portrayal of a true story, while others criticized it for its excessive violence and sensationalism. The film also faced legal issues from the real-life gang members and their relatives, who claimed that it violated their privacy and dignity.
